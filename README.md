# SeorangAbi AI Agent

SeorangAbi AI Agent is a specialized component of the SeorangAbi platform that serves as an intelligent bridge between the SeorangAbi API and Large Language Models (LLMs). Its primary function is to transform natural language queries into optimized SQL statements, enabling team members to access database insights without SQL expertise.

This agent interprets user questions from Discord, processes them through an LLM, and generates secure, read-only SQL queries that interact with the SeorangAbi database system.
